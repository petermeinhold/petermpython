Hi everyone, sorry I didn't start this conversation a week ago, but:

We're all listed on the section on null tests
of the systematics paper that Daniele is leading, and I agreed
to be the contact person. So far I've only written a paragraph
or two, but I thought we might agree at least on an idea of what
to do in this section before the telecon tomorrow. (today for all
of you guys).

I'm going to suggest we have an introduction paragraph, covering
similar points to Davide's memo on the standardized null tests.

I'll want to point out that some 'null' tests work so well that they
are the basis for some of our noise estimation (the 1/2 ring 'jackknives',
(which aren't really jackknives). 

I'll point out also that some 'null'
tests aren't expected to be null, and are used to validate things like the
sidelobe model (although after the FSL subtraction, we should have a null,
which will be explored in the FSL section).

I'll try to logically connect TOD nulls, map domain nulls at various time steps of the difference, 
angular power spectrum 'nulls' (angular power spectra of the difference maps).


We'll also mention some or all of  Davide's other examples (horn to horn, frequency to frequency).

Then we'll have a section with examples, including maps with survey differences 1/2 ring JK,
Angular power spectra of difference maps.

Somehow we'll need to sum all this up!

I think there are significant questions we'll need to decide on before we can get this section 
under control:

1. How many examples can we afford to put in, and what ones will we use.?

2. Shall we illustrate utility of the tests by showing how we used them to choose calibrations?

3. How do we quantify 'passing' a null test in map domain (I don't think we actually 
have an answer for this ourselves).?

4. Same question in Angular power spectra?

5. Do we discuss cross spectrum tests as well?

6. Will we be limited to the nominal surveys (this strongly limits some of
the nulls, so no year1-year2 etc.)

7. Will we include differences with Wmap?


others????

For now, I'll give Daniele an outline based on this (and any suggestions from you guys I get before 
2 am PDT!)


Again, sorry for starting this so late!

Cheers
Peter
